- Seedlings (![Maturity Level: 1|14](https://lakeofthoughts.codyduncan.net/img/tree-1.svg)) are thoughts barely started. 
- Saplings (![Maturity Level: 2|14](https://lakeofthoughts.codyduncan.net/img/tree-2.svg)) have a substantial amount of content, but much work to be done.
- Trees (![Maturity Level: 3|14](https://lakeofthoughts.codyduncan.net/img/tree-3.svg)) are grown up coherent piece of thought/essay/expression that should not change much except for some editorial enhancements.
-  Withered (![Maturity Level: withered|14](https://lakeofthoughts.codyduncan.net/img/withered.svg)) are the notes expressing outdated views (totally or partially) but kept for the historicity of our thoughts. For partially outdated notes, warnings will be placed wherever appropriate.
- Stones (![Maturity Level: stone|14](https://lakeofthoughts.codyduncan.net/img/stone.svg)) are notes exported/extracted from other mediums (e.g. Reading highlight and notes). Growth is irrelevant for these notes.
- Signposts (![Maturity Level: signpost|14](https://lakeofthoughts.codyduncan.net/img/signpost.svg)) are notes that allow us to navigate easily (e.g. Collection of books or writings).
