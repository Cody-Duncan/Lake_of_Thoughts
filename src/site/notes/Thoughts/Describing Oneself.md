*poetic description* - using imaginative or sensitive emotional style of expression to describe something.

E.G. "You're awesome. You're a badass in blue jeans, with the wind at your sails and your sights set on the far horizon. What might stop you should be afraid to try." 

compared to a more simple expression that's not really poetic
'You're great. You got this."

Hypothetical: the ability to *describe* something with sincere and evocative *poeticism* often comes from intimacy with the subject. It may be prerequisite.

If we take that as an assumption, it should be somewhat easy to deeply describe a person with whom one shares a close and intimate connection. If you have, or have had, someone like that, how do you describe them to yourself? to others?
Was it easy to describe them poetically?

Contrarily, a lot of people I've met struggle or completely fail to describe themselves. How do you describe yourself to yourself? to others? Was it easy to describe yourself poetically?

If both were easy or difficult, then it's probably just the prerequisite skill of poetic writing alone is enough.

If describing another was easy but describing yourself was difficult, and assuming this has some relation to the intimacy with the subject, what does that say about one's intimacy to oneself?

On the other hand, poetic descriptors are often used to describe the height of experiences. We have been with ourselves our whole lives, so the peaks and valleys all kinda' muddle together with the rest of the time with ourselves. Maybe there's a moment of our internal experience we could describe poetically, but the whole thing is too completely broad and complex to easily distill into a kind of elegant conciseness.

On the other hand, those that have been close with us have seen us in slices of that experience, at our peaks of our best selves or the troughs of our darkest days. Their perspective is already distilled by time, and simply awaits a hand to express it. That expression describes something less complete, but no less ourselves than hearing our own voice whispering in a dark room by their side. To us it was chit-chat, to them it might have been the world. 

Maybe we could see ourselves the way they see us if we more carefully examine our meaningful self. To stop thinking about all the effort, perhaps struggle, that went into putting the colors of our life experience on a canvas. To step back and appreciate the way others see it, not as an amalgamation of strokes, but simply as the beautiful painting we spent so long trying, often failing to craft. 

Maybe it's even more fun to share what image you see with others, because you know that no two people see the same image. The image is of a dog in the middle of a parade. Why is he there? One suggests he simply passed through before the procession and excited the crowd. Another proposes he was a hero that saved many. A third sees a dog on his way to voyage across the oceans. You know that you meant for it to be a nightly stroll. The stars and petals look like confetti, the backdrop of people are misshapen lamps, and the dog is having a joyful strut in the streets on a breezy spring night. But the other realities are no less real to them then yours is to you. Maybe it's really all of those things, just from slightly different angles and perspectives. Maybe that dog is courageous, adventurous, brave, relaxed, joyful, and a little forthright. Maybe you're the dog, and you've just spent a minute or two staring at yourself from different lenses.

**Can you see yourself through a new lens?
Who are you?
Can you describe that person).. poetically?**

If you find it difficult to bring to words, ask someone else who, or what, they see.  
Take a moment to sit from their perspective until you're a little more accustomed to being apart from your own.

I wrote this thinking about how much easier it is to be expressive about someone else's virtues, but contrarily we struggle a lot to describe our own. I still wonder why this dichotomy exists. This was the first imperfect attempt at examining it.
