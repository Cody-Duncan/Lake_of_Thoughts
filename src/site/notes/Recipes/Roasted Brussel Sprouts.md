Ingredients
- 3 pounds (1.4kg) Brussels sprouts, [bottoms trimmed, outer leaves removed, cut in half](https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-prepare-brussels-sprouts) (see note)
- 1/4 cup (60ml) extra-virgin olive oil, divided (see note)
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 8 medium shallots, sliced thinly (see note)
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) balsamic vinegar or aged sherry vinegar

Directions
1. Adjust oven racks to upper and lower middle positions and place a rimmed baking sheet on each rack. Preheat oven with sheets to 500°F (260°C).
2. In a large bowl, 
	1. add sprouts, 3 tablespoons of the olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste and toss to combine. 
	2. Once the oven has reached temperature, working quickly, remove the baking sheets with a dish towel or oven mitt and divide Brussels sprouts mixture evenly between both trays, shaking sheets to distribute into a single even layer. 
	3. Return pans to the oven. Roast for 10 minutes. 
	4. While Brussels sprouts roast, in the now-empty bowl, toss shallots, remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste to combine.
3. Working quickly and carefully, divide the shallot mixture evenly between the two sheets and stir with the Brussels sprouts to combine.
	1. Rotate and swap pans top to bottom in oven. 
	2. Continue to bake until Brussels sprouts are deeply charred and fully tender and shallots begin to brown, 10 to 15 minutes more.
4. Immediately after removing sheets from oven, drizzle sprouts with balsamic vinegar and shake to coat. Season to taste with more salt and pepper if desired and serve.
