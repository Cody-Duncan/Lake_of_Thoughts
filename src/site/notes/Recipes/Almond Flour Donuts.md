## Ingredients

 - [ ] 1 cup Blanched almond flour
 - [ ] 1/3 cup Erythritol
 - [ ] 2 tsp baking powder
 - [ ] 1/8 tsp Sea salt
 - [ ] 1 tsp Cinnamon
 - [ ] 1/4 cup Butter (unsalted; measured solid, then melted)
 - [ ] 1/4 cup Unsweetened almond milk
 - [ ] 2 large Egg
 - [ ] 1/2 tsp Vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Tap on the times in the instructions below to start a kitchen timer while you cook.

2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (177 degrees C). Grease a nonstick donut pan well.

3. In a large bowl, stir together the almond flour, Besti, baking powder, cinnamon, and sea salt.

4. In a small bowl, whisk together the melted butter, almond milk, egg, and vanilla extract. Whisk the wet mixture into the dry mixture.

5. Transfer the batter evenly into the donut cavities, filling them 3/4 of the way. Bake for about 15 minutes (longer for a silicone pan, possibly less time if your pan is dark – but this lighter nonstick pan works best), until golden brown.

6. Cool completely in the pan. Run a mini silicone spatula along the edges of the donuts (a knife also works, but may scratch your pan), then twist and gently release.

7. Pour Besti Powdered into a small, shallow bowl. Press both sides of the donuts into the powder to coat. (You can also use a different frosting or glaze if you prefer.)
