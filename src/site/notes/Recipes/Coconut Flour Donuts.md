## Ingredients

- [ ] ½ cup coconut flor
- [ ] ¼ cup Erythritol, or Swerve Sweetener
- [ ] 1 teaspoon baking powder
- [ ] ¼ teaspoon salt
- [ ] 4 large eggs
- [ ] ¼ cup coconut oil, melted
- [ ] ½ cup unsweetened almond milk
- [ ] ½ teaspoon vanilla
- [ ] ¼ teaspoon stevia
- [ ] Oil for frying; coconut, grapeseed, etc.

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325F and grease a donut pan well.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the coconut flour, sweetener, baking powder and salt.
3. Stir in eggs, coconut oil, almond milk, vanilla and stevia until well combined and batter is smooth.
4. Fill wells in donut pan about ⅔ full (you will have leftover batter and will need to do another batch).
5. Bake about 16 minutes, or until set and just barely brown around the edges. Remove from oven and let cool 5 minutes in the pan, then flip out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with remaining batter (I got 10 donuts out of my pan).
6. In a large skillet, add oil so it is about ½ inch deep. Heat over medium heat.
7. While oil is heating, combine toasted coconut and powdered sweetener in a medium bowl.
8. Once the oil is hot, add 5 or 6 donuts to the pan. Flip after 1 to 2 minutes (they brown quickly), and cook the other side another minute or so. Remove from the pan and quickly dip each side in the coconut coating, pressing lightly to adhere.
9. Let cool slightly on wire rack (they are really good warm out of the oil!).
