## Ingredients

**Strawberry-Balsamic Topping**
- [ ] 2 cups sliced strawberries  
- [ ] 2 tablespoons good-quality balsamic vinegar  
- [ ] 1/4 cup sugar  
- [ ] 1 tablespoon lemon juice

**Brown Sugar Rub and Flank Steak**
- [ ] 3 tablespoons brown sugar (light or dark is fine)
- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon onion powder
- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon chipolte chili powder
- [ ] 1/8 teaspoon ground dry mustard
- [ ] 1/8 teaspoon smoked paprika (regular can be used as well)
- [ ] 1.25 pounds flank steak, trimmed of fat
- [ ] 1/4 cup crumbled gorgonzola cheese

## Directions

**Strawberry-Balsamic Topping**
1. Combine all ingredients in a small bowl and set aside at room-temperature to macerate, about 2 hours.

**Brown Sugar Rub and Flank Steak**
1. Preparing the Brown Sugar Rub: 
	1. Mix together all ingredients in a small bowl. 
	2. Whisk until well-combined. 
	- This is enough for 1-1.25 pounds of meat. Feel free to double or triple or even more for larger cuts or to have some on hand at any point. 
	- Store in an airtight container if not using right away.
2. Preparing the flank steak: 
	1. Trim the flank steak to your liking. 
	2. Place between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound to desired thinness (this will also help tenderize this cut of meat). 
	3. Take pounded cut and rub your dry rub in, using all of it, on both sides so the meat is covered. 
	4. Now, grill to your desired doneness (we like medium rare in this house). 
	5. Take off the grill, cover with foil, and allow to rest for 5 minutes or so. 
	6. Slice into 4 pieces. Serve topped with balsamic strawberries and crumbled gorgonzola cheese.
