## Ingredients

Marinade:
- [ ] 1 lime
- [ ] 1/2 cup sake or dry white wine
- [ ] 1/3 cup white miso
- [ ] 1/3 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro, more for garnish
- [ ] 1/4 cup olive oil
- [ ] 2 Tbs. honey
- [ ] 1 scallion, finely sliced
- [ ] Kosher salt

Grilling:
- 1 lb. assorted vegetables, such as mushroom caps, bell peppers, zucchini, and red onions, trimmed and cut into 1- to 1-1/2-inch chunks
- Also works with Beef and Chicken

## Instructions

1. Finely grate the zest of the lime into a small bowl, then juice the lime into the bowl.
2. Add, by whisking in, the sake, miso, cilantro, oil, honey, scallion, and 1/2 tsp salt.
3. Thread the vegetables onto metal or soaked wooden skewers. Put the skewers in a nonreactive (stainless-steel, glass, or plastic) container and pour the marinade over them, turning to coat on all sides.
4. Marinate for at least 1 hour at room temperature.
5. Heat grill to medium-high heat (400-475F // 205-245C)
6. Remove the skewers from the marinade, shaking off the excess.  
   Grill the skewers, basting with the marinade and turning occasionally, until vegetables are tender. 
7. Season to taste with salt and (optionally) garnish with cilantro.
